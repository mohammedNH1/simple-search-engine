A Simple Search Engine
This project implements a basic search engine that processes, indexes, and ranks documents based on user queries.

Features
Document Processing: Cleans and preprocesses text (removes stop words, punctuation, converts to lowercase).

Indexing: Builds an index of words and an inverted index to map terms to documents.

Query Processing: Supports Boolean queries (AND, OR) and ranks documents using term frequency.

How It Works
Document Processing: Reads documents, tokenizes, and preprocesses text.

Indexing: Creates an index and inverted index for efficient search.

Query Handling: Processes Boolean queries and ranks documents by term frequency.
